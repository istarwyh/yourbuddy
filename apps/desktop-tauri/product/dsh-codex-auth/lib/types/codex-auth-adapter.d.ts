/**
 * The LLM adapter half of the codex-auth plugin: registers the `openai-codex`
 * route with a pi-ai-backed adapter that resolves the ChatGPT access token
 * from the live codex auth file (refreshing through the official OAuth
 * endpoint when it is about to expire) instead of through the credentials
 * seam — which is single-provider by design and cannot be extended from a
 * plugin.
 *
 * Everything provider-specific — the chatgpt.com/backend-api Responses
 * protocol, tool calls, SSE/WebSocket transports, the model catalog — is the
 * installed pi-ai `openai-codex` provider, wrapped by the harness's own
 * `PiAiAdapter`; this package supplies the credential, route, and a narrow
 * request-scoped replay, Portable-call capture, and one-shot automatic
 * compaction turn continuity for Native Checkpoints.
 *
 * The route streams over SSE by default: pi-ai prefers a WebSocket connection
 * (`wss://chatgpt.com/backend-api/codex/responses`) with a 15-second connect
 * timeout and a per-session SSE fallback, but the WebSocket upgrade is
 * unreliable through common HTTP proxies, and every new conversation pays the
 * connect timeout again before the fallback engages. Pinning SSE removes that
 * cliff (prompt caching via the `session-id`/`prompt_cache_key` still applies);
 * `auto` and `websocket` remain selectable for networks where the WebSocket
 * works.
 *
