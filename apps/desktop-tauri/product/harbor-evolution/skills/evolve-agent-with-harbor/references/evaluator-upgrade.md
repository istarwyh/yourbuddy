# Evaluator Upgrade Workflow

Load this reference when the user wants to improve score reliability or change Evaluator, Rubric, Judge, reward semantics, or meta-evaluation.

## Clarify the evaluator objective

Inspect `harbor_eval_result view=governance` and representative Trial evidence first. Resolve:

1. Which false positives, false negatives, disagreements, or calibration failures matter.
2. Who owns the independently maintained GT, its source kind and provenance, and how adjudication works.
3. Which meta-metrics define improvement: RCR, precision/recall, bias, variance, calibration, latency, or cost.
4. The allowed Evaluator/Rubric/Judge mutation surface and budget.
5. The approval owner for adopting new score semantics.

Do not use the Candidate Agent to author its own GT. Do not infer GT from the current Evaluator output.

## Ingest reviewed reports in the user's language

Prefer evidence the user already has over a schema questionnaire. Accept:

- a pasted report followed by a pasted score, review, or recommendation;
- report and review file paths;
- a directory containing several report/review pairs;
- an exported table or document whose rows can be traced back to individual reports.

Ask for missing report/review pairing only when it cannot be inferred safely. Query text, source material, citations, and execution traces are useful context but optional unless the active Rubric needs them.

Preserve the raw report and raw review before normalization. Build a review draft with one row per report and Criterion:

| Field | Rule |
| --- | --- |
| Report | Stable case label and source path or pasted-input reference |
| Criterion | Map to the active Rubric; propose a new Criterion only when the review clearly introduces a distinct standard |
| Score | Preserve an explicit score; otherwise infer only through the accepted Rubric scale |
| Reason | Extract the reviewer's stated basis without strengthening it |
| Recommendation | Preserve the reviewer's suggestion; if absent, leave it empty rather than inventing expert intent. It does not block a confirmed scoring label |
| Evidence | Keep the shortest exact source excerpt that supports the normalized row |
| Status | `explicit`, `inferred`, or `unresolved` |

Show this draft in plain language. Do not mention protocol fields in the first confirmation. Ask a targeted question such as “这里更接近部分满足（0.5），还是完全不满足（0）？” instead of asking the user to edit JSON. Combine all unresolved rows into one short confirmation when possible.

Only confirmed rows may become formal GT. Preserve the raw material alongside the normalized case so later reviewers can audit whether the Agent translated the text correctly. Record who or what produced the review, when available. If the reviewer source is unknown, state that provenance remains unresolved and keep the Dataset diagnostic-only.

One reviewed report is useful for wiring and discussion but cannot establish general reliability. When several examples exist, keep representative normal cases and historical failures, and reserve an untouched group for final comparison. The Optimizer may learn from the tuning group; neither the Candidate evaluator nor the Optimizer may see holdout labels before the final measurement.

## Create a new immutable evaluator identity

Show the current identity, source, proposed diff, and expected semantic impact. Create new files and increment component plus Evaluation Stack versions. Never edit a historical Evaluator, Rubric, Judge identity, or old Job artifact in place.

Use the `harbor-dsh-evaluator/v1` Descriptor as the implementation boundary:

- `kind=script` for deterministic code, rules, or local models.
- `kind=llm-as-judge` for a model-backed judge; keep credentials out of source and identity artifacts.
- Both kinds consume `evaluation-input/v1` and return `evaluation-result/v1` with Descriptor-declared Criterion ids and score values.
- Every Criterion also requires non-empty `reason` and `recommendation` strings. Missing fields invalidate the evaluator result; Reporter never fabricates them.
- `editable_files` is the exact source allowlist used by the Workbench and `harbor_evaluator_update`.

Call `harbor_evaluator_inspect` to capture the active digest. After explicit approval, `harbor_evaluator_update` requires the expected file digest plus new Evaluator and Stack versions, copies the whole bundle to a new version directory, and switches the active Stack. It never launches evaluation or Gate.

Treat changes to any of these as reward-semantic changes requiring a new Context and fresh Agent baseline:

- Evaluator source or digest.
- Rubric source or digest.
- Judge provider, model, version, or parameters.
- Evaluation Contract metric meaning or hard requirements.

## Meta-evaluate before adopting

The current capability is an independent artifact workflow, not a Harbor Job kind: `harbor_ground_truth_init` creates the provenance-bearing GT draft, repeated Evaluator runs produce fixed observations, and `harbor_evaluator_meta_evaluate` writes `meta-evaluation-report/v1`. It does not run inside a Historical Generation Job, and it does not emit a `job_kind=evaluator-meta-evaluation` Job. A future dedicated Job may package this existing workflow into a recoverable lifecycle.

Rotate roles:

- Candidate: the new Evaluator/Rubric/Judge version.
- Dataset: independently maintained examples with provenance-bearing GT and disagreement metadata.
- Evaluator: deterministic comparison between evaluator decisions and GT.
- Reporter: RCR and accepted diagnostic slices.
- Gate: explicit human-approved adoption decision.

Use the same GT set, repeat policy, and measurement procedure for old and new evaluator Candidates. Report coverage, invalid measurements, aggregate metrics, disagreement slices, latency, cost, and representative errors. Do not select only favorable runs.

GT is not synonymous with human labeling. It may be human, programmatic, consensus-based, produced by a separately pinned model, or imported from an external standard. Require explicit provenance and independence from the Candidate evaluator in every case. Use `harbor_ground_truth_init` to create the versioned draft and `harbor_evaluator_meta_evaluate` to calculate ESF, SCE, and RCR from repeated observations. Keep a Historical Job's own `evaluator_meta_evaluation.status=not-run`; never attach a separate report implicitly or derive it from Session Population scores.

The user supplies reports and review evidence; the Agent performs the protocol adaptation. Do not ask the user to hand-author `ground-truth/v1` or `evaluator-observations/v1`. After confirmation, generate the strict files, validate them, run repeated Evaluator observations, and retain a reversible mapping from every normalized field to its raw source.

## Re-baseline Agent progress

After the evaluator Candidate passes its explicit Gate:

1. Update Evaluation Stack identity.
2. Preview Candidate Context v3 and confirm old Agent Jobs are no longer comparable.
3. Run the current Champion Agent as a fresh baseline under the new evaluator.
4. Compare later Agent Candidates only against Jobs sharing the new Context digest.

Adopting an evaluator does not mutate, promote, deploy, or publish an Agent automatically.
