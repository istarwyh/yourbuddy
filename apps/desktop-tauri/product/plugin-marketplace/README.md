Part of the [DeepSeek Harness Enhancement Suite](https://github.com/Scorp1o117/dsh-enhancement-suite) — Vision · Soul/Persona · Long-term Memory · Plugin Marketplace.

A **plugin marketplace** inside the DeepSeek Harness Web UI: browse
[github.com/topics/dsh-plugin](https://github.com/topics/dsh-plugin) right
from the settings page — no terminal needed.

- **Search** the topic by keyword, **sort** by stars or last update
- **Plugin cards** with description, stars, language, and update date
- **Detail panel**: GitHub README summary, install command, repo/npm links; the
  YourHarness desktop opens these links through a restricted system-browser bridge
- **One-click eligibility**: enabled only after npm package metadata links a
  package with `dsh.bundle.patch` to the repository through its Repository
  field or owner-scoped DSH upstream metadata; differently named scoped
  packages and repositories with sibling SDK/CLI packages are supported
- **Install status**: progress and actionable pnpm failures stay attached to
  the package the user confirmed
- **AI explain**: one click asks the configured default model what a plugin
  roughly does, answered in the UI — no need to read the README yourself
- Powered by the public GitHub search API (CORS-enabled, no key needed;
  unauthenticated rate limit 60 req/h)
- Zero client dependencies (React only), no build step — hand-written
  ModuleLoader bundle

## Install

As a profile bundle (recommended):

```
dsh plugin --profile web add dsh-plugin-marketplace
```

or via the package's `dsh.bundle.patch` layer — add `dsh-plugin-marketplace`
to `dsh.profile.bundles` in `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/package.json`.

Manual mount in `$DSH_HOME/profiles/web/cordis.patch.yml`:

```yaml
- insert:
    - id: plugin-marketplace
      name: 'dsh-plugin-marketplace'
```

> **Upgrading from ≤ 0.2.2?** If you previously mounted the plugin manually,
> **remove that row from `cordis.patch.yml`** before switching to the bundle
> install — the bundle layer already inserts the entry, and two entries with
> the same id abort boot with `duplicate loader entry id: plugin-marketplace`.
> The two ways are alternatives, not both.

Then restart `dsh web` (new client plugins require a process restart to be
scanned into the browser roster) and open **Settings → Plugin Marketplace**.

DSH `0.1.0-rc.7` and newer expose every registered settings namespace, so the
marketplace works without patching official files. Version 0.2.8 and newer
therefore require DSH `0.1.0-rc.7` or newer. DSH `0.1.0-rc.6` users must pin
`dsh-plugin-marketplace@0.2.6`, the last release carrying the legacy
settings-allowlist compatibility patch.

DSH `0.1.2-rc.1` removed the client-side `connection.api` (the legacy settings
RPC face); version 0.3.1 therefore writes through the bound `settingsScope`'s
own `mutate` (hosts older than `0.1.2-rc.1` still use the legacy channel).
Note: when dsh web is opened from a non-loopback origin (a LAN IP, say), DSH
keeps settings writes process-local, so install / AI-explain requests never
reach the host.

## How it works

| Layer | File | Role |
|---|---|---|
| host shell | `index.js` | settings-backed install + AI-explain flows; `dsh.bundle.patch` makes the package a proper profile bundle |
| browser half | `client.js` | registers the `settings.section` "marketplace" tab; fetches GitHub search API; renders cards + detail; "AI explain" button |
| manifest | `package.json` | `dsh.bundle: { patch: "./cordis.patch.yml" }` + `dsh.client: { platform: "web" }` + `exports["./client"]` — discovered by `dsh-client-modules` |

The browser half needs no `dsh.client.inject` packages: it only uses `react`
(provided by the web runtime) and the `slots` / `locale` client services.

## Notes

- The GitHub search API returns at most 1000 results; the topic currently has
  280+ repos, so paging covers everything.
- READMEs are fetched per plugin on demand and truncated to ~1200 chars.
- GitHub topic membership is discovery metadata, not proof that a repository
  publishes an installable DSH Bundle. Missing, ambiguous, or incomplete npm
  identity metadata leaves one-click installation disabled.
- If you see "rate-limited", wait an hour or run the web through a proxy that
  adds a GitHub token.
