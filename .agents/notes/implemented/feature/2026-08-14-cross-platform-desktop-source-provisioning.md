# Agent Note: Cross-platform desktop source provisioning

Status: implemented

## Problem

The desktop shell needs small installers for users who do not have a Harness development environment. Shipping the complete workspace dependency tree makes installers large and slow to assemble, while assuming a system Node installation makes startup depend on unmanaged host tools. A release also needs independently attributable artifacts for each supported operating system and architecture without publishing a partial platform set.

## Decision

**Desktop installers carry a trimmed source tree and built application artifacts, but no `node_modules`.** First launch copies that immutable resource into application data, scans the host for a Node that satisfies `^22.19 || >=24` and a usable pnpm, downloads the platform Node archive only when the scan finds none, installs pnpm through the selected Node only when needed, and runs `pnpm install --prod --no-frozen-lockfile` with `CI` removed. Mirror endpoints remain configurable through `DSH_NODE_MIRROR` and `DSH_NPM_REGISTRY`. Host matching and Harness-home adoption are owned by [desktop host toolchain scan and home adoption](2026-08-14-desktop-host-env-and-home-adoption.md).

**Each source bundle has an isolated writable tree.** The content hash selects `harness-versions/<bundle-hash>` so an update never deletes files held by an older running Host. Compatible Node and pnpm runtimes remain shared and are reused across source updates. The native shell admits one application instance and focuses its existing window on another launch. Fallback accepts only bootable trees, provisioning steps carry deadlines, and superseded trees are cleaned up ([desktop rc.7 provisioning failure and unbootable fallback](../bug-fix/2026-08-19-desktop-rc7-provision-fallback.md)).

**The selected Node owns all provisioning commands.** Windows x64 and x86 use the official zip layouts; macOS x64/arm64 and Linux x64/arm64 use tar.gz layouts. Archive entries must remain below the expected versioned Node directory. Tar extraction preserves Unix permission bits, npm resolves from the platform-specific Node distribution layout, and a privately installed pnpm runs as JavaScript through the selected Node binary. A host pnpm is invoked directly when the scan found one.

**One tag publishes one complete desktop matrix and one signed update manifest.** A `desktop-v*` tag builds Windows x64/x86 NSIS installers, macOS Intel/Apple Silicon DMGs, and Linux x64 AppImage/deb packages. Each matrix job signs its Tauri updater artifact and uploads operating-system-and-architecture-qualified files; a dependent release job verifies the complete set, creates or updates one GitHub prerelease, and replaces `latest.json` in the stable `desktop-updater` release channel. The updater public key is embedded in the application, while the private key and password exist only in release secrets and the maintainer's protected backup. Updater signatures authenticate downloads, but the executables remain without operating-system code signing or notarization.

[YourHarness product workbench distribution](2026-08-22-yourharness-product-workbench.md) narrows its product release to macOS arm64 and a separate `yourharness-updater` channel while retaining this provisioning mechanism.

**Release builds check and install updates after the main window opens.** Only one automatic or tray-triggered check runs at a time, and the manifest request has a 15-second deadline so a failed or slow network does not hold the splash or an active workbench. The official Tauri updater compares the embedded application version with the stable manifest, accepts only a higher semantic version, validates the artifact signature, installs the update, stops the private Host, and restarts the application. The tray shows the embedded version; a manual check reports that version when it is current, while an available update announces the current and target versions before downloading. Check and download failures are logged without closing the workbench. Development builds skip network update checks. A ready runtime manifest that still names a usable Node and pnpm skips the host toolchain scan, seed, and `pnpm install`, and compares Node by file size instead of hashing `node.exe` ([repeat-boot skip](../bug-fix/2026-08-17-desktop-repeat-boot-host-toolchain.md)).

**Windows installation closes the running application and invalidates stale shortcut icons.** The NSIS pre-install hook terminates `dsh-desktop.exe` with its child process tree before files are copied. The post-install hook preserves the user's desktop-shortcut choice, recreates an existing shortcut against a version-qualified standalone ICO resource, and notifies Explorer that icon associations changed.

**One fish mark identifies every native surface.** The transparent black SVG path is shared with `FishLogo.tsx`; generated PNG, ICO, and ICNS resources feed the Tauri bundle, NSIS installer and uninstaller, configured splash window, runtime-created main window, and Windows shortcut refresh.

## Alternatives considered

**Ship a complete offline dependency tree.** Rejected because the workspace dependency closure produces a very large installer and expensive filesystem operations. The trimmed source bundle keeps the release artifact small while retaining the exact built Harness application.

**Rely on the host toolchain with no private fallback.** Rejected because fresh Windows, macOS, and Linux systems often have no Node, or have a version outside `^22.19 || >=24`. Compatible host toolchains are scanned first; the private runtime remains the fallback. See [desktop host toolchain scan and home adoption](2026-08-14-desktop-host-env-and-home-adoption.md).

**Let each matrix job publish its own release assets.** Rejected because concurrent release creation can race and exposes a partial release while other platforms are still building. The final job publishes only after every required artifact exists.

**Publish only the locally verified Windows x64 installer.** Rejected because the desktop release contract includes Windows x86, both macOS architectures, and Linux x64, and runtime archive handling must match those binaries.

**Point installed applications at each version-specific prerelease.** Rejected because an endpoint embedded in one version cannot discover the next tag, while GitHub's latest-release redirect excludes prereleases. A constant release channel gives every installed version one durable manifest URL while versioned releases continue to own the downloadable artifacts.

**Implement update download and signature verification directly.** Rejected because Tauri's updater already defines platform artifact formats, semantic-version comparison, mandatory signature verification, Windows installer handoff, and application cleanup. A custom updater would duplicate security-sensitive behavior.

## Consequences

Installers remain compact, but first launch still needs network access when the host has no compatible Node or when the bundled tree has no `node_modules`, and that path can take several minutes. Runtime files and dependencies occupy application data rather than the installation directory. Source updates may temporarily retain an older bundle-specific tree while its Host still holds files; a later cleanup can remove inactive trees without blocking startup. Automatic updates require a newer semantic version, so replacing assets under the same tag bootstraps updater support only for users who reinstall that version once. Losing the updater private key or password prevents trusted updates for installed clients. The release workflow spends build time on the full platform matrix and fails publication when any required package or signature is absent. Manual Windows installation forcibly closes active application work, and users must explicitly approve binaries where operating-system security policy requires it.
